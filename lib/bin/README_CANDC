The C&C parser is freely available, but we can't download it automatically from within Pimlico, as you need to
register on the website and use your authentication details to download it.

Do the following to fetch the C&C parser.

1. Go to
     http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/wiki/Register
   and register for a free account.
2. Go to
     http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/wiki/Download
   and download an appropriate set of binaries for your system.
3. Extract the bin/ directory from the archive and put it in this directory, naming it "candc".
4. Follow the instructions in models/candc/README to get hold of pre-trained parsing models.

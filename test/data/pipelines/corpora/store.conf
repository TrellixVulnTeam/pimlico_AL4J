# Group works as a filter module, so its output is not stored.
# This pipeline shows how you can store the output from such a
#  module for static use by later modules.
# In this exact case, you don't gain anything by doing that, since
# the grouping filter is fast, but sometimes it could be desirable
# with other filters

Estonian Reference Corpus
=========================
A small subset

https://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/segakorpus/

This is a tiny subset containing a few files from the corpus. It's used here as an example of
reading in a corpus from XML files. The core Pimlico input module for XML files can be used
to read the Est Ref corpus in its original form.

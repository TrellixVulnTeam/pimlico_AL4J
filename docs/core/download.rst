===================
Downloading Pimlico
===================

To start a new project using Pimlico, download the
`newproject.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markgw/pimlico/master/admin/newproject.py>`_ script. It will
create a template pipeline config file to get you started and download the latest version of Pimlico to accompany
it.

See :doc:`/guides/setup` for more detail.

Pimlico's source code is available on `on Github <https://github.com/markgw/pimlico>`_.

Manual setup
============
If for some reason you don't want to use the `newproject.py` script, you can set up a project yourself.
Download Pimlico `from Github <https://github.com/markgw/pimlico>`_.

Simply download the whole source code as a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file and uncompress it. This will produce a directory
called `pimlico`, followed by a long incomprehensible string, which you can rename simply `pimlico`.

Pimlico has a few basic dependencies, but these will be automatically downloaded the first time you load it.

  Pimlico Wishlist
=====================

Things I plan to add to Pimlico:

- Easy parallelization for document map module types
- Handle software dependencies within Python

  - Those that can be installed directly can be installed as part of the pre-run 
    checks
  - Simply output instructions for others (e.g. system-wide install required)

- *I'll add to this list as I think of things...*

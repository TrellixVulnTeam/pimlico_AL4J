Berkeley Parser
===============

https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser

Java constituency parser. Pre-trained models are also provided in the Github repo.

Probably no need for a Java wrapper here. The parser itself accepts input on stdin and outputs to stdout,
so just use a subprocess with pipes.

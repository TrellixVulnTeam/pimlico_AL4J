=====================
  Pimlico Wishlist
=====================

Things I plan to add to Pimlico.

- Further modules:

  - :doc:`CherryPicker <cherry_picker>` for coreference resolution
  - :doc:`Berkeley Parser <berkeley>` for fast constituency parsing
  - `Reconcile <https://www.cs.utah.edu/nlp/reconcile/>`_ coref. Seems to incorporate upstream NLP tasks. Would want
    to interface such that we can reuse output from other modules and just do coref.

- **Pipeline graph visualizations**: :doc:`drawing`. Maybe an interactive GUI to help with viewing large pipelines
- See `issue list on Github <https://github.com/markgw/pimlico/issues>`_ for other specific plans
- Big redesign of datatype implementation is `documented as a Github project <https://github.com/markgw/pimlico/projects/1>`_

Todos
=====
The following to-dos appear elsewhere in the docs. They are generally bits of the documentation I've not written
yet, but am aware are needed.

=====================
  Pimlico Wishlist
=====================

Things I plan to add to Pimlico.

- Further modules:

  - :doc:`CherryPicker <cherry_picker>` for coreference resolution
  - :doc:`Berkeley Parser <berkeley>` for fast constituency parsing
  - `Reconcile <https://www.cs.utah.edu/nlp/reconcile/>`_ coref. Seems to incorporate upstream NLP tasks. Would want
    to interface such that we can reuse output from other modules and just do coref.

- Output pipeline graph visualizations: :doc:`drawing`
- Bug in counting of corpus size (off by one, sometimes) when a map process restarts

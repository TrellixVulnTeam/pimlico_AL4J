Can't fetch via make script, as you need to sign-up for a login (free). Need to get user to do this. Pain in the arse.

Written wrappers around C&C before using subprocesses (with the REST server). Can reuse most of this code as is.

Consider also whether it's even worth wrapping this. Might be better off just using the new Java implementation,
which is faster and as accurate.

.. py:module:: pimlico.modules.spacy


Run spaCy tools and pipelines on your datasets.

Currently only includes tokenization, but this could be expanded to include
many more of spaCy's tools.

Or, if you want a different tool/pipeline, you could create your own
module type following the same approach.

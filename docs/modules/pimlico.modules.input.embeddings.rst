Embeddings

.. py:module:: pimlico.modules.input.embeddings


Read vector embeddings (e.g. word embeddings) from various storage formats.

There are several formats in common usage. Here we currently wrap only a couple, but there are
others (e.g. word2vec binary) that would be worth including as well.

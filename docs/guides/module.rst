  Writing Pimlico modules
===========================

.. todo::

   Write a guide to building custom modules

.. note::

   In any case where a module will process a corpus one document at a time, you should write a
   `document map module <map_module>`, which takes care of a lot of things for you, so you only need
   to say what to do with each document.

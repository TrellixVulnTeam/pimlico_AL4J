Demo code
=========

Some demo pipelines and datasets.

You can run the pipelines using the `run_example.sh` script. All this 
does is to run the Pimlico command-line interface with the local config 
in `examples_local_config`, so that a special local storage directory is 
used for pipeline data.

There's not a lot here at the moment, so consult the [docs](http://pimlico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead. 
What is here is really just to support the examples in the docs.

A wider array of example pipelines can be found in the form of **test pipelines**.

* See the `test/data/pipelines` directory

Demo code
=========

Some demo pipelines and datasets.

You can run the pipelines using the `run_example.sh` script. All this 
does is to run the Pimlico command-line interface with the local config 
in `examples_local_config`, so that a special local storage directory is 
used for pipeline data.

These example pipelines are 
[included in the Pimlico documentation](https://pimlico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_config/index.html), 
where they are cross-referenced with the core module types they use.

More full example pipelines will be added in the future.

A wider array of example pipelines can be found in the form of **test pipelines**.

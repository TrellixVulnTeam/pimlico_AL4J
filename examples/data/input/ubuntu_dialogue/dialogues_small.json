Is port 80 generally secure?\nOr is that generally what's targeted?\nThat depends on what webserver you are running\nIt is generally apache or apache2 which runs 60%+ of the internet\nWhich is a yes\nWhat about general home users?\nPeople running Windows machines\ngeneral home users have no business running a webserver. Uninstall apache\nYou can still nmap a home user's IP, though...\nfirewall firewall firewall. That will prevent 90% of the script kids from messing with you because they are too ignorant to do anything else\nHow effective are software firewalls installed on routers?\nbecause that's all I have enabled currently\nIf you didn't know, the majority of newer routers are just embedded linux distros\nI didn't know :)\nSo most modern router's built in firewall software is very secure?\nIt is as secure as it as configured. But as a rule, yes\nGo ahead and ask pretty much anything computer security or networking related\nAs long as it's not, 'How do I hack?'\nAwesome :D\nHow do I hack?\nI have kismet and ethereal :P\nhttp://dban.sourceforge.net/ Boot with it and just keep on pressing enter. Thats how you become a hacker\nYou have to have something listening on a port to hack into your computer\nThat is a linux distro that will securely delete everything on every harddrive it can mount\nBT is relatively secure. Search www.secunia.com for exploits. And then www.packetstormsecurity.org for the actual code\nhahahhahahah... That's actually good to know. Are the myths of the FBI being able to find every deleted file on your harddrive true? :x\nwww.encase.com. That is the software the fbi uses. In high profile cases, they use hardware designed for data recovery. That is very true\nThere are governtment standards and then there is the guttman method of secure deletion\nwhen I nmap <my ip> it states there's 1 IP addres (my router), how can I scan using nmap to discover the subusers of the router?\nYou can't. It's called a firewall\nUnless you establish a tunnel through it. But that is another day\nSo most apache servers don't go through firewalls?\nApache is a secure webserver. End of story. It has more usage than anyother one on the internet\nRight :)\nNext question, of 2^342923423423423... When I access kismet dumps (var/log/kismet), and open them up with Etheral... Where exactly does it list information?\nYou actually NEED to understand networking and how a packet is laid out to understand packet dumps\nI don't guess you have much networking experience\nWe were talking about possibly going into CS in 2 years (after I knock out my GED courses)\nNice. You might also read up on dsniff\nBut you want to learn, that is important\nI want to learn a lot\ngo to www.packetstormsecurity.org and search for pdf.

You'll have to rename the file before invoking startx\nI want to execute 'startfluxbox' sometimes without editing '.xsession'\nI'm not familiar with startfluxbox.  Assuming it has the same limitation as startx, I recommend writing yourself a tiny script that renames ~/.xsession, invokes startfluxbox in the background, waits a second or two, and renames .xsession back to its original filename\ngood idea, but,, ugly hack\nman startx says 'startx [ [client]  option ] '\nyes.  It's the old-fashioned way of doing it.  If you really don't like it, fix the source code.  startx is a bash script so that's easy.  Dunno what startfluxbox is.\nstartfluxbox is another script like startkde and startgnome and so on..\nok then.  So modify startfluxbox to give it an option to specify an alternate config file to ~/.xsession .  Specifying /dev/null will allow you to bypass the standard config file.\nits alright I will just mod my startx\nok."

I just want to pin the kernel to linux-image-2.6.20-14-386_2.6.20-14.22 instead linux-image-2.6.20-14-386_2.6.20-14.23\n- thats actually fairly simple - if I understand you propely - you dont want to upgrade your kernel anymore?\n I want to force the kernel upgrade to linux-image-2.6.20-14-386_2.6.20-14.22 instead of linux-image-2.6.20-14-386_2.6.20-14.23 using apt, yes.\n- OK then take a look at http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.en.html - if you have a problem with that get back to me and we will work trhough it with a pastebin and your current configs - Let me grab a smoke and a coffee first though :)\n- the section you want on that page is 3.10\nok then... thanks.\nI see now..  I knew I needed to pin it, I just could only find info on pinning whole repositories... thanks.\n: how is that looking to you?\nIt's running my apt-get dist-upgrade without forbidden errors ;)\n: always good - you can use that method to downgrade if ou get into dependecy hell too - not sure how common that is with ubuntu but its always good to know\ndid I have to run 'apt-get update' or would it have read the preferences without that?\n- you dont need to run an update first, It is used by apt to determine what to install rather than what package lists to download (it will download everything anyway I think)\nyeah...  I've only ever pinned backports and my personal repos before... should have rtfm.\n: well in that case - disregard all I have said so far and RTFM!! :)\nI put too much faith in google 'apt pin package version' and the like... I know.  google's never really failed me before.\n- I always find the debian documentation great - or failing that gentoo has an excellent wiki for most other things (X configuration etc..)\n- no excuses now you could have used the bot or the Debian/Kubuntu/Ubunut/Mepis Manuals... shame on you\ndebian documentation does rock, I should have taken a look... but that bot link wasn't as helpful as the manual.\nthanks a lot for pointing me to that manual :)"

If it does, well, gratz to me :D\nCool, hope it works :D\nWell, I failed.\nI 'm guessing you got stuck at a command prompt after you did everything?\nYeah after i did everything, it kicked me back to the command prompt and i was like uhh.\nBut you got to set your graphics up, that all went ok?\nOK, i forgot to tell you how to re-enable the graphics, sorry :S\nXD\nafter you do your graphics type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop\nthen sudo gdm\nthat will kill gnome which is running in the background (gnome is the display manager)\nand then sudo gdm will restart it with the new settings\nOk, and hopefully that will work xD\nAlright I am going to try that\nAgain if it fails, I will be back\nhope that work\ncool\nI fail again\nI do /etc/init.d/gdm. stop and it works fine\nWell i don't think so, when I do sudo gdm, it tells me it is already running\nOk and what should i do after i get there\nYeah i am on another one now\nIts in another room but I will move back and forth\nI went through the setup again, did /ect/init.d/gdm stop, then ctrl+alt+f7, and got a blank screen\nclick ctrl-altf1 again\nOk at the console again.\nWhat do I do now that I am back at the console.\nSo sudo gdm says gdm already running?\nhmm... I doubt it, the problem is that your on a live cd, so therefore any changes we make cant be saved. usually its easier to reboot and have X use the new settings, but i'm not sure how to kill x withough gnome\nhang on, im looking it iup\n...so what should I do then :/\nOh ok, go look.\nok ive got it!\ntype in sudo ps waux\nOk and what do I do when I find it\nok, just type sudo killall KILL x-session-manager\n(with those capitals)\nOk trying that now\nI did that, heard like a double-conga hit sound, but I still have no GUI\nok, well that means that your choices in the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg wernt right...\ntry using the vesa driver and choose a nice safe resolution like 800x600\nOk, then do I need to do the KILL command again when i get done?\nyes\nand then make sure your in terminal 6,7 or 8 (ctrl-alt-f6/7/8)\nI did everything again, I got the conga sound and a start-up sound this time, but I still have no GUI\n:S ???\nIs that a 'I have no idea what your talking about :S' or a 'I don't know what to do now :S'\nso youve tried all ctrl-alt-fx buttons?\nthats a I dont really know what the hell is wrong\nHmm no, only 1,7 and 8\nthe VESA driver is bullet proof\nI used vesa on this go around.\nI did a sudo killall KILL gdm and that seemed to of ended gdm\nthen sudo gdm, and it restarted gnome, but with no picture still\nthis is most odd.... only other solutions I have are to download either the alternate cd and do a text install, or maybe your current cd is dodgy\ncan you burn the iso again at a nice slow 4x?\nyes i can, considering i did it at 48x last go around :S\nyeah, fast usually = bad with operating systesn\nAnd a text install sounds *puke* to me\nyeah, and if your graphics still wont work, thatd be all you were stuck with :S\nGreat alright, well I will try the slow burn. A friend of mine got ubuntu installed so I will ask him what he did\nYou can always wait 2 days and get the latest feisty release, which takes out nearly all the headaches\nsorry i couldnt help more\nI think i know what was wrong\nI had the i386 distro, when I should of had the amd64 distro\nIt shouldnt matter\n64 bit processors will run 32 bit code\nand if you were getting that far, there wasnt a problem :P\nthats ok\nanyways, for now 32 bit will save you some hassles later\nI return. I have sucessfully installed ubunut, after figuring out that i had to disable my SLI on my video cards. My question is now getting wireless working. After reading the forums I am at a stand still. I have installed wifi radar. I am using a Linksys WMP54G wireless card.\nThats excellent, shame SLI doesnt work.\nYes, I hope there is support soon, I don't want to keep taking out and putting the card back in for use in windows.\nwhat was your card again?\nLinksys WMP54G, with a Broadcam BCM4306 chipset\nI'm just looking to see if it has drivers\nAlright, in SuSE i tried using ndiswrapper and that was a terrible failure, considering i couldnt find instructions to save my life.\nunfortunately its still NDISWrapper for you, but heres a complete guide for your card http://dossy.org/archives/000110.html\nwell I hope i can get this working...i am going to download the files off that site, as well as NDISwrapper\nAnd give it another go\nid get the ndiswrapper from the ubuntu repos though\nOk...i am going to have to find that\nConsidering i dont know where to look xD\nstart up synaptic and then enable the universe and multiverse by clicking manage repositories\nthen update the lists and you should be able to find it\numm lol, you lost me there. I am not a linux genious by any means\nthats ok, just click system>>>administration and click on Synaptic Package Manager\nOK i am going to go try that, getting help from two sources is confusing me XD\nAnyways, what im telling you is useful as it will also make sure your software is all up to date\nOk, I am attempting to get the correct packages installed\nI cant find what you are talking about in synaptic\nok, click settings>>>Repositories\nOk then what were the two i was doing...\nthen enable the universe and multiverse\nOK, let me do that\nthen when you close it, it will tell you to update your lists, so to do that, click reload\nDo i need to load the LiveCD...i dont see anywhere to load universe and multiverse?\nare you running edgy or feisty?\nedgy\nand your in gnome right?\ncorrect\nwell it when you click on repositories, there should be a bunch of check boxes\nThere isnt there...but when i go back to the main screen i see a whole bunch of packages that are either ticked or not...\nwell lets get your wireless up first, download that package from Jordan_U and unzip it to /lib/firmware\nok let me get my thumbdrive and do that\nOk, going to load the firmware\nawesome, after youve done that you have to restart\nok, its telling me I dont have permission to write to /lib/firmware\numm...\nis it Ark? or some other unzipping program?\nWell i didn't use an unzip program...i extracted them to my thumbdrive and tried to drag and drop the files to /lib/firmware\noh ok, well open the terminal and use 'sudo cp /path/to/thumbdrive /lib/firmware\nok, lets see if i can figure that out then\nI tried to wing it typing the commands but i couldn't do it. My thumbdrive is called ZOMGWTFBBQ!\nlol\num, im not sure where abouts usb devices are mounted\nyeah i dont know either...can i take the winzip archive, put it on the desktop, then try it from there?\nI have them on the desktop now\nis it a series of files or just one folder\nok cool, open the terminal and type sudo nautilus\nOk, then what\nI knew that...lets see if i figure this out...brb\nI have the firmware placed in /lib/firmware should i put it in the next folder /lib/firmware/2.6...\nyeah, i think thatd be right\nok, going to do that\nAlthought that also means that when you update the kernel, those drivers wont cary accross\nI can re-add then afterward\nShould i restart now\ndid you just add the folder or the seperate files\nthe seperate files\nok cool, restart and i shall see you soon :P\nhope so lol\nmany MANY thanks\nI am now online\nthe only bad part is, now when we run synaptic, we're probably going to be updating the kernel, so you'll have to re-copy the files when thats donw\nSo, lets fire up synaptic and give it a whirl\nthat is fine, I am so happy that i can get online now"

The hardware support is pretty amazing actually considering most of it is reverse-engineered\nanyways, thanks for helping the noob :P\nwhen did compiz-fusion come out, and how's it different from compiz or beryl?\nnot sure.. but it is a little more stable... has some nicer features and is more streamline\nI guess I could just RTFM, nevermind... but it's less buggy than beryl or compiz you say...? I may have to try that...\nsweet :) are they working beryl into default ubuntu anytime soon? or is it still just something you can get to if you're 'in the know'?\nwere you able to see that picture... i managed to freeze ubuntu\nyeah, it's pretty cool\nI'm trying to do updates and security has just gone down for me... I can no longer connect (although I could a minute ago)"

Unable to mount root filesystem. I suspect the array may have failed, anyone know of a way to rebuild these?\ndo you know what type of raid?\nunfortunately no, I suspect raid 5 or raid 0, as it's three disks but I'm unsure.\nso you cant even boot the thing.  do you know if the os is on the raided drives?\nno experience with linux raid unfortunately, the disks appears to have a boot sector with grub etc etc, and a larg 150gig of unpartitioned drive\nYes, its running Kubuntu 7.04. I beleive the /boot/ sectors are in tact, however when it attempts to mount the root partition and run the terminal it fails\n/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control off\nah, okay, can you pastebin your /boot/menu.conf ?\nSorry blag, I was mistaken there. It's the boot sectors that are in tact, not the /boot partition\nso what, if any, files can you read?\ntheres initrd, config, vmlinuz etc in the root, and a grub folder and a lost+found folder\nwhats in the grub folder?\ndefault, device.map, e2fs_stage1_5, fat_stage1_5, installed-version, jfs_stage1_5, menu.lst, menu.lst.new, menu.lst~, minx_stage1_5, stage1, stage2\na couple of other filesystem stage files as well if you need me to list them\nprefer pastebin tbh\nI'm looking at it from a application on another machine which i was trying to use to recover the raid at the moment, you want me to boot back into the system and post a ls of the grub directory for you?\nand, tbh, i would rather you grab a livecd and use that, so we dont touch the system, but i kinda want to get you past grub\nso if you have a livecd, nows the time to use it.  it not, please reboot and tell me whats in grub\nalright i'll boot up the ubuntu live cd now\nsorry, dcd for a second there? did you get that? http://pastebin.com/m6f85228d\ni got it that time\ncool =)\nperhaps im being too harsh but that configuration of files is really messed up...\nhow so?\nit seems that everything in the /grub directory is a conglomeration of files that are in my /boot and /boot/grub directories...\nwould you mind pastebinning your /grub/menu.lst ?\noh, wait, i just figured it out...\nhttp://pastebin.com/m56262fd\nokay, the menu.lst looks fine to me, what happened when you tried to boot it?\neverything seems to load find, kernel modules etc however it gets to: Check root= bootarg cat /proc/cmdline\nor missing modules, devices: cat /proc/modules ls /dev\nThen it's unable to find /dev/tty\nsorry, i keep rebooting here.\nerr, disconnecting rather\nno worries, i could tell\nso the last thing it did was not find /dev/tty ?\nlast message it gives is '/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control off'\nmay have gotten something a bit mixed up there, sorry if I had you looking at the wrong thing\nno worreis\nany idea what may be causing the problem? I'm at a loss =(\nmaybe a kernel bug: http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg279620.html\nok, in which case I'd have to replace the kernel?\nsee my last message in the channel\nwell, you will also have to point grub to the updated kernel, of course\nnot normally in charge of this machine, just trying to help a mate out. I'd say it's been over a year. It was instlaled in june 2007, doubt itd been updated since then\ni'll start there then. should I just be using the latest version of the kernel or what? It's running ubuntu 7.04\ncheck out the date on the last comment: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/106123   if your friend didnt update the box (although it looks like he updated from -15 to -16) before leaving it alone, he could have had a weird kernel or seomthing\ni would play it safe and see if you can get the latest kernel for 7.04.  on the other hand, the actual kernel may be a little messed up, so you may want to try replacing that with the same version (-16) as before\nalright, I'll give that a try. Is it as simple as swapping the files out and pointing grub at the new kernel?\nat any rate, i need to get to bed, as ive reached the end of my knowledge on the subject and my sleep\ni think it is, but, truth be told, ive never done it\nthanks for all your assistance, I really appreciate the help.\nfrom what i know of the boot process, it *should* be that simple\nalright, i'll make a backup and give it a try. Thanks heaps for your help. I'll see if that works.\noh, and tell whoever set the machine up to leave the /boot directory alone next time\nwell, and you might want to make sure that / wasnt lost in the wind, as you could have been mounting /boot when you meant to be mounting the / directory"

Done\nwhat packagename does this say here? http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=gpgme.h&mode=exactfilename&suite=hardy\ni install that package as well sir\n: no change\n make clean  - then try again\nmake clean is important\ngpgme.h is located : /usr/include/gpgme.h\nunless i need to specify the path to the gpgme file, this is a lost cause for me\n sudo aptitude install    libgpgme11-dev;  make clean;  ./configure && make\nno luck. still exiting with error code 2 and a host of gpgme errors\nlet's see the new output then.\n: http://pastebin.ca/1238901\nyour error keeps changing - it's not the same - review the output, identify which header is missing, install it and repeat the process\nok. wish me luck"

'fsck' and nothing else? what exactly are you running a fsck on than?\nwere you prompted to run fsck? did you get error's while you were booting? more info if you can provide it\n I was running it cause I have a little book here and it says that fsck will find and repair inconsistencies.  I was wondering if that is what was causing my computer to reboot spontaneously.  Just was a guess\nno it most likely will not cause it to spontaneously reboot unless your getting errors while rebooting.. your restarting is prolly a hardware problem.. you should NEVER run fsck on an already mounted filesystem.. IE: drop to a recovery shell and run it.. not from a terminal in Gnome\nyou understand why you shouldnt run fsck on a mounted filesystem right?\nlast night when i was playing chess on the computer, the machine just rebooted spontaneously and gave me this screen and it locked up.\nthats interesting.. was it the built in Chess or a 3rd party installed game... btw, running fsck on a mounted filesystem will usually cause data corruption..\nIt was the chess that came with the program\nis it the first time its happened?\n Yes,.  I asked last night if that was just a red herring and now one had an answer\nwhat verison of buntu are you running? and are you fully up to date?\n8.04\ni suppose 8.04.2?\nits the oneon the main dowload site.\n I had a problem with 9.04 64.\ni mean, have you downloaded all of the updates\nyes\nall updates are done.\nwhat graphics card & drivers are you using?\nIntergrated Video AMD/ATI http://www.compusa.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4016440&CatId=2320\nim sorry im stumped.. try poking around in /var/log and check the logs for around the time it happened and see what you dig up\nHow do I check around.  I have no idea\nyou can just go to Places > Computer > var > log\nmy bad, Places > Computer > Filesystem > var > log\n the syslog only goes back to 00:50 this AM\nthere should be more.. with like a .1 or .2 after it.. they might be .tar.gz archives or something.. I am not too familiar with the logs\nI wish I knew more, but I am still learning myself. I will try to help you as much as I can though\nThank you very much Wigg\nsorry I couldnt be further help\n there was a tone of info here compiled on what happened at the time.\nnow you just have to sift through it lol\ni have used it\nwhats up man, did you fix your random reboot prob?\nIt happened again today after I put everyting in the new barebones.  I decided to give it one more try on 8.04 so I reinstalled it.  We will see\nI do not think the problem is the computer hardware since it happend again in a New environment.  I would bet there is something wrong or some incompatability somewhere\nwell I wish you the best of luck.. might you try Intrepid or Jaunty if it doesnt work? because they might support the hardware (or whatever) better... whats your question about Asus Expressgate? I have an ASUS G50Vt-X1\nI tried to install expressgate to no avail.\non a pure linux install?\nyes.  That is one reason it does not make sense to me\nIts a linux program\nthe ASUS Express Gate REQUIRES a windows install unfortunitly because its a proprietary version of Slashtop\n  That is unfortunate\nyes it is.. slashtop is a nice program and I havent found a way to tap into the Solid State disk which contains the mini OS, but if I figure it out.. you will be the second to know.. (ill be the first of course lol)\nthank you.\nASUS the company does not openly (or actively) support Linux.. unless you get a 'real' tech support guy on the phone\nnp man, I have given up on Windows all together and thats one thing I miss is Express Gate... =*(\nyou know how to get ahold of me?\nno, I dont.. but im sure ill run into ya\nI am however going to try to Install Vista in a Virtual Machine and install Express Gate to see if that works\nyou saw the Vid on youtube of the guy who got expressgate on a thumb drive?\nno, you can private message me the link though (as to not press any linkage rules in here)"

I have an 80gb hdd and I have almost got it full with select downloads. I wish to zip to download more. I plan to write the zipped files on DVDs. Is it reasonable?\nit's more efficient to get a bigger hard drive if you can, to be honest with you. 1, the zipped files will be unplayable in any dvd player, only readable on a computer, and 2, they would load quite slowly on your computer, as you'd have to temporarily extract each time to view the video. Video files are generally pretty big, even at low quality. What kind of computer are you using? Brand, Desk or Laptop, Model?\nit's really really inexpensive to update your hard drive, you can even install an extra alongside your current so you don't even have to reinstall your operating system. check craigslist if you're in the states, ebay if not, for an IDE hard drive, though personally i'd go with an external\nI also am thinking on getting an external 500gb drive. But in the meanwhile... I just would not want to get stalled! Thanks Dr_Willis ! and bye!\nyou're probably better off deleting your videos then, or getting a cheap flash drive and compressing to those. they're bigger than dvd's., more reliable generally, and you can rewrite them\nthough I do not know much about yr problem, I intend to of some help. I googled and found something: uname -r = Print the operating system release level? does it mean anything to you?\nI used the release level in place of uname -r and it still came up with the same problem\nhey! in your command line you mention something about unamer whereas uname is the command? Would you recheck?\nI get 2.6.24-27-generic substitute for uname -r. I note that this does not have any space in between. Did you try that?\nnoises? I had a similar problem with audacious. I changed sound driver. (keep changing always:-)) It helps - alsa, arts,esd.,oss,pulse audio.. OK. All the best. This much for my effort."

What you'll need to do is run fsck on your hard drive partitions to fix them without them being mounted.\nthanks I will do just that\n/dev/sda  /dev/sda1  /dev/sda3  /dev/sda5\nAh. So as long as those partitions aren't mounted in your live environment, you should be able to do fsck -p /dev/sda1 ... the -p means automatic repair (no questions).\nThat is only for a partition if it is using ext2 filesystem.\nfsck without the .ext2 should work\nI think the drive is ext3 or ext4, how do I run it without the .ext2?\nfsck -p /dev/sda1\nI just tried what you said and I got the same error again\ntry fsck -f on a partition that is corrupt (i think i was /dev/sda5)\nall of them seem to be corrupt\nyou'll need to specify the partition number .. so fsck -f /dev/sda1\nhmm i found something a bit more interesting for sda2\nhttp://pastebin.com/JxEPB6yy\nHmm. What happened. Did sda1 fsck successfully?\nOkay. Checking.\nno that one got the same error as earlier\nHmm can you paste df -Th please.\nhttp://pastebin.com/udnRzMjQ\ne2fsck -b 8193 /dev/sda2\nhttp://pastebin.com/Q9wbx0ju\nI wonder why it keeps trying to fsck /dev/sda2 as if it were an ext2 file system, hmmm. So sda1 went fine? If so, try to fsck -f /dev/sda3 (next partition)\nsda1 didn't go fine, it gave the same error as earlier\nhttp://pastebin.com/L7nh1xmw\ne2fsck -c will do a bad blocks test. If this works, there will be some questions where you'll answer 'yes' to.\ni'm assuming i do that for each drive/partition?\ncorrect.\nhttp://pastebin.com/Vi1QGiqC\nhmm so its always complaining about superblocks not being read. It looks like the superblock will need to be specified with fsck.ext3 -b <superblock #> /dev/sd*  ... so I'm not sure if this will work in the live-cd, but you can try: /sbin/mkfs.ext2 /tmp/foo ... it will then tell you /tmp/foo is not a block special device would you like to proceed, you'll say 'y' ... this will tell you the number of 'blocks' ... let me know if thi\nwhat is the exact command i put in?\nI just remembered you can't mount any of those partitions ... because you could run 'df' and it will tell you the total number of blocks for each partition.\nso what do i do?\nwhen you boot Ubuntu (not live-cd) does it bring you to a command prompt?\ni can't even boot it\nbecome root with su and try dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep superblock\nhttp://pastebin.com/j8dMtzmB\nyou did mention the drives were over 5 years old?\nyeah i did\nif you can boot into single user mode you can try and hopefully find the superblock number for each partition\nhow would i do that?\ndmesg > output  ... will get it all\nOh dear.

Concerning the heat, it's possible (and somewhat likely) that because hard drives tend to conduct heat, it feels hotter after some time.  I'd still check out the heatsink.  As far as disk power management goes, I forget how it's done\n but give powertop a whirl too.  it's in the default repositories\nyeah, but i'm on the commandline system so i doubt the problem is too much software"

I Belive you replace the space with somnthing like \\040 (i have to look it up all the time)\n ive tried //192.168.0.20/020-0Television0Series /mnt/tv cifs uid=server,user=xbmc,password=xbmc 0 0 but still no luck\n as i said.. You replace the space with the proper 'escape code' or fix the share on the shares server to not have a space.\nsorry for my ignorance what is the propper escape code... ?\n what about the - between 02 - Television will that be a problem...?\n any spaces need to be fixed..  I dont use spaces in share names.. I suggest you follow that guideline. makes life much easier"

Not server. Where I ran ssh-keygen already. ON THE SERVER.

Its all because I am confusing the terms on the guide with something else I guess. It said to run that command on the client. By that I understand the computer I will be connecting FROM. So I did run ssh-keygen on client, with folder set at 777 or 755 permission . whatever guide said\nYes. I am doing that then\nOh btw.

I get the error:  libdbusmenu-glib4 breaks gir1.2-unity-3.0 (<< 3.8.4-0ubuntu2)  gir1.2-unity-3.0 (version 3.8.4-0ubuntu1) is present and installed.  dpkg: er\nror processing libdbusmenu-glib4_0.4.93-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb (--install):  installing libdbusmenu-glib4 would break gir1.2-unity-3.0, and  deconfiguration is not permitted.        Can anyone help me out?\nyou have the problem because you're using 11.10 packages with 11.04\nwell no as that's an unstable release.\nis there anything that would allow me to continue gtk3 development on ubuntu? Should I currently just wait for 11.10 to come out?\nI think you've messed up your machine to be honest as it will have pulled in more than gtk with dependencies\nhere's hoping that the machine isn't too badly messed up. It's seems to run fine. I just can't get one error to go away while I am developing my code. I might try the virtual machine route that kyle__ suggested."

It would just be a way around no network problem. I'm guessing that the 'downloading' thing is false and that they're really in the ramdisk. If so, i'll try modprobing it, though i'm surprised about the 'system requires restart' business. But of course there could be firmware issues too...\n'system requires restart' is an easy way of telling someone to modprobe :)\nthe kernel loads modules upon modprobe or restart.\n>>is an easy way of telling someone to modprobe Yes - slightly too dumbed down perhaps? ;)\nno not really. From a design point of view, it's the best thing ever. Telling your normal office worker to open a terminal and write 'sudo modprobe' is too difficult. Making a script that does that is too risky.\nMaybe, yes.\nget a connection because you cannot download drivers without any internet\nBut this is where we came in ;) They must be already there as the system 'downloaded' them with no net connection - or did it?\ntexas ^^"

Because that is the first screen during installation.\nDid you do a md5 hash check to see whether you've got a proper iso image that isn't corrupt?\nDo that.  Also, do you have an exotic graphics card?\nCheck the md5 hash and see it if matches.  Most likely a corrupt iso file.\nIf not, something to do with the graphics drivers.

Also, while you're out, just check the settings for your wifi in your bios and make sure everything is switched on and active in there, too\ni know they are as my primary os is windows and wifi isn't an issue there\ndoesn't appear the module loaded\ndunno if this is of any use, but my lspci -v has this for my wireless: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1109179/\nso what now?\nhadn't told me to do anything i just been sittin here\nok, here's what I need you to do.\nstill working for you this end, please bear with me :)\ncould you possibly edit that rules file please?\nwhere that file says: DRIVERS=='?*'  could you change that to DRIVERS=='iwl4*' and see if that makes a difference please?\nyou already have it\ncould you please download the drivers from Intel's download center, intended for windows XP... the link is: http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&DwnldID=19851&ProdId=3229&lang=eng\napologies for the delay, and thanks for your patience. Do you have that driver file downloaded now?\ncan you see if there is a file on there listed as driver only please, possibly one for IT\nok - so you should now have the folder extracted, can you open it and check there's a .inf file in there please?\nnow I know what it's done.\ni'm sorry, I think i'm gonna have to hand you over to someone else, or ask if you can pop in tomorrow evening when I'll be slightly brighter"

Move to the parent directory, do 'rm -rf network-manager-0.9.4.0' then 'dpkg-source -x network-manager_0.9.4.0-0ubuntu4.1.dsc' then 'cd network-manager-0.9.4.0' then 'debian/rules build' then 'fakeroot debian/rules binary'\nwell warnings are usually OK ... though it is good practice to capture the build log and review it just in case\nAgainst a library that isn't already a dependency of the package (which is defined in debian/control on the source 'build-depends:' line\nsystemd0wn I meant had you captured the messages from running dpkg -i ?

NIS is a nice way of doing this, reasonably secure (not hugely, but reasonably).\nIf you want to use solaris software, but display it on ubuntu, you can use X forwarding, via XDMCP, or ssh/telnet into solaris, set your DISPLAY variable to your ubuntu system, and run the software.\nYou want a remote solaris desktop? That would be either XDMCP or VNC,\nXDMCP is very very fast, but your data can be sniffed on the wire, so it's only for internal use.\nYes.  If you google for XDMCP, you can find articles on the LTSP site.  They should get you pretty far.\nYou may have to enable some stuff on the solaris server, but I doubt it.  This stuff has been enabled by default from back when it was SunOS (BSD based), through every version of solaris I played with.\nOf course the last one I played with was quite awhile ago."

"""Core Pimlico modules

Pimlico comes with a substantial collection of module types that provide wrappers around existing NLP and
machine learning tools, as well as a number of general tools for processing datasets that are useful for
many applications.

Some modules that used to be among the core modules have not yet been updated since a big change
in the datatypes system. They can be found in ``pimlico.old_datatypes.modules``, but are not
currently functional, until I get round to updating them.

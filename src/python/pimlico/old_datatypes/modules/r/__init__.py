"""R interfaces

Modules for interfacing with the `statistical programming language R <https://www.r-project.org/>`_.
Currently, we provide just a simple way to pass data from the output of another module into an R script and run it.
In the future, it may be appropriate to add more sophisticated interfaces, or expose R's functionality in a more
specialised way, integrating more closely with Pimlico's datatype system.
